<p>Earth has many different places. It can be a country, city, town, or your own home. It's such a big world and we have so much
places to go to. It can be going to the mall, the grocery store, traveling to another country, etc. We may think we can travel or
go to any place in the world. However, there are places that are restricted or protected that we, any local person, cannot go to.
what are <b>Protected Areas</b>? From what we know, protected areas are places that we are not allowed to enter. According to
International Union for Conversaion of Nature:</p>

<blockquote>
<i>"A protected area is a clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective
means, to achieve the long term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values."</i>
<br><span style="padding-left:5em">~~~IUCN Definition 2008~~~</span>
